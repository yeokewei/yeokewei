Trained in Design and AI, I like to face challenges head-on towards innovation. I'm well-versed in Python 🐍.

🔭 I’m currently working on Rhino, Grasshopper tools for enhancing Architects' workflow using AI and automation!

🌱 I’m currently learning RhinoCommon and C# scripting (hopefully making a grasshopper plugin)

🤔 I’m looking for help with [AI Spatial layout generation](https://xximagazine.com/c/augmenting-design-space-layout-generation-with-ai)
